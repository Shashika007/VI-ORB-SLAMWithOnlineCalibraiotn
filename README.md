# VI_ORB_SLAM2: Monocular/Stereo Visual-Inertial ORB-SLAM based on ORB-SLAM2

The repository includes the **Monocular** version and the **Stereo** version of **Visual-Inertial ORB-SLAM**. These two are the no ros version of  [jingpang](https://github.com/jingpang)'s [**LearnVIORB**](https://github.com/jingpang/LearnVIORB) and [ZuoJiaxing](https://github.com/ZuoJiaxing)'s [**LearnVIORBnorosgai2**](https://github.com/ZuoJiaxing/LearnVIORBnorosgai2). For details, you may refer to  `Examples/Monocular/mono_euroc_VI.cc` and `Examples/Stereo/stereo_euroc_VI.cc`. 

I have fix some bugs to make it more stable to pass through more datasets and modify the code to make it compatible with [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2). 

Not bug-free. Not real-time.

If you think this repo is useful, please ***watch***, ***star*** or ***fork*** it!

## TO DO List
- [ ] Real-time 
- [ ] Support the Localization mode for stereo VI ORB-SLAM
- [ ] Relative Pose Error Analysis, like orientation and translation error


## Building VI-ORB-SLAM2 library and examples

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/YoujieXia/VI_ORB_SLAM2.git VI_ORB_SLAM2
```

We provide a script `build.sh` to build the *Thirdparty* libraries and *VI_ORB-SLAM2*. Please make sure you have installed all required dependencies (see section 2 of ORB-SLAM2 README). Execute:
```
cd VI_ORB_SLAM2
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This will create **libORB_SLAM2.so**  at *lib* folder and the executables **mono_tum**, **mono_kitti**, **rgbd_tum**, **stereo_kitti**, **mono_euroc**, **stereo_euroc**, **mono_euroc_VI** and **stereo_euroc_VI** in *Examples* folder.


## Example commands for running on the EuRoC Dataset.
1. Download a sequence (ASL format) from http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets

2. For Mono VI ORB-SLAM:

MH_01_easy
```
./Examples/Monocular/mono_euroc_VI Vocabulary/ORBvoc.bin Examples/Monocular/EuRoC_VI.yaml PATH_TO_EuRoC/MH_01_easy/mav0/imu0/data.csv PATH_TO_EuRoC/MH_01_easy/mav0/cam0/data.csv PATH_TO_EuRoC/MH_01_easy/mav0/cam0/data MH_01_easy
```
3. For Stereo VI ORB-SLAM：

MH_01_easy
```
./Examples/Stereo/stereo_euroc_VI Vocabulary/ORBvoc.bin Examples/Stereo/EuRoC_VI.yaml PATH_TO_EuRoC/MH_01_easy/mav0/imu0/data.csv PATH_TO_EuRoC/MH_01_easy/mav0/cam0/data.csv PATH_TO_EuRoC/MH_01_easy/mav0/cam0/data PATH_TO_EuRoC/MH_01_easy/mav0/cam1/data MH_01_easy
```


> Note that we use the `ORBvoc.bin` instead of `ORBvoc.txt` to speed up processing. The `ORBvoc.bin` could be generated by the executable `bin_vocabulary` at *Vocabulary* folder. You may still refer to the end of `CMakeLists.txt` to see how it works.

## Results

The temp results are stored at *tmp_result/mono_VI/* and *tmp_result/stereo_VI/* for Monocular and Stereo VI ORB-SLAM respectively. In each folder, files about camera poses, IMU biases, scale are saved.

### Quantitative Evaluation
Here we use the translation RMSE (m)  of the keyframe trajectory as the metric. The results are shown below.

# ORB-SLAM2
**Authors:** [Raul Mur-Artal](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~raulmur/), [Juan D. Tardos](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~jdtardos/), [J. M. M. Montiel](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~josemari/) and [Dorian Galvez-Lopez](http://doriangalvez.com/) ([DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2))

**Current version:** 1.0.0 

ORB-SLAM2 is a real-time SLAM library for **Monocular**, **Stereo** and **RGB-D** cameras that computes the camera trajectory and a sparse 3D reconstruction (in the stereo and RGB-D case with true scale). It is able to detect loops and relocalize the camera in real time. We provide examples to run the SLAM system in the [KITTI dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) as stereo or monocular, in the [TUM dataset](http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset) as RGB-D or monocular, and in the [EuRoC dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) as stereo or monocular. We also provide a ROS node to process live monocular, stereo or RGB-D streams. **The library can be compiled without ROS**. ORB-SLAM2 provides a GUI to change between a *SLAM Mode* and *Localization Mode*, see section 9 of this document.

# 2. Prerequisites
We have tested the library in **Ubuntu 12.04**, **14.04** and **16.04**, but it should be easy to compile in other platforms. A powerful computer (e.g. i7) will ensure real-time performance and provide more stable and accurate results.

## C++11 or C++0x Compiler
We use the new thread and chrono functionalities of C++11.

## Pangolin
We use [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) for visualization and user interface. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.

## OpenCV
We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Required at leat 2.4.3. Tested with OpenCV 2.4.11 and OpenCV 3.2**.

## Eigen3
Required by g2o (see below). Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0**.

## BLAS and LAPACK
[BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas) and [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack) libraries are requiered by g2o (see below). On ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev
sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
```

## DBoW2 and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)
We use modified versions of the [DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2) library to perform place recognition and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library to perform non-linear optimizations. Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the *Thirdparty* folder.

## ROS (optional)
We provide some examples to process the live input of a monocular, stereo or RGB-D camera using [ROS](ros.org). Building these examples is optional. In case you want to use ROS, a version Hydro or newer is needed.

  ```
  ./Examples/RGB-D/rgbd_tum Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/RGB-D/TUMX.yaml PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER ASSOCIATIONS_FILE
  ```

# 7. ROS Examples

### Building the nodes for mono, monoAR, stereo and RGB-D
1. Add the path including *Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM2* to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable. Open .bashrc file and add at the end the following line. Replace PATH by the folder where you cloned ORB_SLAM2:

  ```
  export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:PATH/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/ROS
  ```
  
2. Execute `build_ros.sh` script:

  ```
  chmod +x build_ros.sh
  ./build_ros.sh
  ```
  
### Running Monocular Node
For a monocular input from topic `/camera/image_raw` run node ORB_SLAM2/Mono. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. See the monocular examples above.

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM2 Mono PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE
  ```

### Running Monocular Augmented Reality Demo
This is a demo of augmented reality where you can use an interface to insert virtual cubes in planar regions of the scene.
The node reads images from topic `/camera/image_raw`.

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM2 MonoAR PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE
  ```

### Running Stereo Node
For a stereo input from topic `/camera/left/image_raw` and `/camera/right/image_raw` run node ORB_SLAM2/Stereo. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. If you **provide rectification matrices** (see Examples/Stereo/EuRoC.yaml example), the node will recitify the images online, **otherwise images must be pre-rectified**.

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM2 Stereo PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE ONLINE_RECTIFICATION
  ```

**Example**: Download a rosbag (e.g. V1_01_easy.bag) from the EuRoC dataset (http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets). Open 3 tabs on the terminal and run the following command at each tab:
  ```
  roscore
  ```

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM2 Stereo Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Stereo/EuRoC.yaml true
  ```

  ```
  rosbag play --pause V1_01_easy.bag /cam0/image_raw:=/camera/left/image_raw /cam1/image_raw:=/camera/right/image_raw
  ```

Once ORB-SLAM2 has loaded the vocabulary, press space in the rosbag tab. Enjoy!. Note: a powerful computer is required to run the most exigent sequences of this dataset.

### Running RGB_D Node
For an RGB-D input from topics `/camera/rgb/image_raw` and `/camera/depth_registered/image_raw`, run node ORB_SLAM2/RGBD. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. See the RGB-D example above.

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM2 RGBD PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE
  ```

# 8. Processing your own sequences
You will need to create a settings file with the calibration of your camera. See the settings file provided for the TUM and KITTI datasets for monocular, stereo and RGB-D cameras. We use the calibration model of OpenCV. See the examples to learn how to create a program that makes use of the ORB-SLAM2 library and how to pass images to the SLAM system. Stereo input must be synchronized and rectified. RGB-D input must be synchronized and depth registered.

# 9. SLAM and Localization Modes
You can change between the *SLAM* and *Localization mode* using the GUI of the map viewer.

### SLAM Mode
This is the default mode. The system runs in parallal three threads: Tracking, Local Mapping and Loop Closing. The system localizes the camera, builds new map and tries to close loops.

### Localization Mode
This mode can be used when you have a good map of your working area. In this mode the Local Mapping and Loop Closing are deactivated. The system localizes the camera in the map (which is no longer updated), using relocalization if needed.
